<title>Kernel Modification Case</title>

        <para>
            Kernel modification involves changing or adding configurations to an existing kernel, or 
            adding recipes to the kernel that are needed to support specific hardware features.  
            The process is similar to creating a Board Support Package (BSP) except that it does not
            involve a BSP layer.
        </para>

        <para>
            This section presents a brief overview of the kernel structure and then provides a simple 
            example that shows how to modify the kernel.

            <title>Yocto Project Kernel Overview</title>

            <para>
                When one thinks of the source files for a kernel they usually think of a fixed structure 
                of files that contain kernel patches.
                The Yocto Project, however, employs mechanisims that in a sense result in a kernel source
                generator.
            </para>

            <para>
                The Yocto Project uses the source code management (SCM) tool Git to manage and track Yocto 
                Project files.
                Git employs branching strategies that effectively produce a tree-like structure whose 
                branches represent diversions from more general code. 
                For example, suppose two kernels are basically identical with the exception of a couple
                different features in each.
                In the Yocto Project source repositories managed by Git a main branch can contain the 
                common or shared
                parts of the kernel source and two branches that diverge from that common branch can 
                each contain the features specific to the respective kernel.
                The result is a managed tree whose "leaves" represent the end of a specific path that yields
                a set of kernel source files necessary for a specific piece of hardware and its features.
            </para>
         
            <para>
                A big advantage to this scheme is the sharing of common features by keeping them in 
                "larger" branches that are further up the tree.  
                This practice eliminates redundant storage of similar features shared among kernels.
            </para>

            <para>
                When you build the kernel on your development system all files needed for the build
                are taken from the Yocto Project source repositories pointed to by the 
                <filename>SRC_URI</filename> variable and gathered in a temporary work area
                where they are subsequently used to create the unique kernel.
                Thus, in a sense, the process constructs a local source tree specific to your 
                kernel to generate the new kernel image - a source generator if you will.

            <para>
                This section presents a simple example that illustrates kernel modification
                based on the <filename>linux-yocto-2.6.37</filename> kernel.
                The example uses the audio and mixer capabilities supported by the

                <para>
                    You need to have the Yocto Project files available on your host system.  
                    The process is identical to that described in the 
                    <xref linkend='getting-setup'>"Getting Setup"</xref> section earlier in this 
                    manual.
                    Be sure to either set up a local Git repository for <filename>poky</filename>
                    or download and unpack the Yocto Project release tarball.

                <para>
                    Everytime you change a configuration or add a recipe to the kernel you need to 
                    do a fetch from the Linux Yocto kernel source repositories.
                    This can get tedious and time consuming if you need to fetch the entire 
                    Linux Yocto 2.6.37 Git repository down from the Internet everytime you make a change
                    to the kernel.  
                </para>

                <para>
                    You can get around this by setting up a <filename>meta-kernel-dev</filename>
                    area on your local system.  
                    This area contains "append" files for every kernel recipe, which also include
                    a <filename>KSRC</filename> statement that points to the kernel source files.
                    You can set up the environment so that the <filename>KSRC</filename> points to the
                    <filename>meta-kernel-dev</filename>, thus pulling source from a local area.
                    This setup can speed up development time. 
                 </para>

                 <para>
                    To get set up you need to do two things: create a local Git repository 
                    of the <filename>poky-extras</filename> repository, and create a bare clone of the 
                    Linux Yocto 2.6.37 kernel Git repository.

                    in this example.  
                    The command creates the repository in a directory named <filename>poky-extras</filename>:

                    You can effectively point to this local clone now during development to avoid

                <para>
                    It is always good to isolate your work using your own layer.
                    Doing so allows you to experiment and easily start over should things go wrong. 
                    This example uses a layer named <filename>meta-amixer</filename>.

                <para>
                    When you set up a layer for kernel work you should follow the general layout
                    guidelines as described for BSP layers. 
                    This layout is described in the

                <para>
                    In the standard layer structure you have several areas that you need to examine or 
                    modify.
                    For this example the layer contains four areas:
                    <itemizedlist>
                        <listitem><para><emphasis><filename>conf</filename></emphasis> - Contains the 
                        <filename>layer.conf</filename> that identifies the location of the recipe files. 
                        </para></listitem>
                        <listitem><para><emphasis><filename>images</filename></emphasis> - Contains the 
                        image recipe file. 
                        This recipe includes the base image you will be using and specifies other 
                        packages the image might need.</para></listitem>
                        <listitem><para><emphasis><filename>recipes-bsp</filename></emphasis> - Contains 
                        recipes specific to the hardware for which you are developing the kernel.
                        </para></listitem>
                        <listitem><para><emphasis><filename>recipes-kernel</filename></emphasis> - Contains the 
                        "append" files that add information to the main recipe kernel.  
                        </para></listitem>
                    </itemizedlist>
                </para>

                <para>
                    Let's take a look at the <filename>layer.conf</filename> in the 
                    <filename>conf</filename> directory first.
                    This configuration file enables the Yocto Project build system to locate and 
                    use the information in your new layer.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The variable <filename>BBPATH</filename> needs to include the path to your layer
                    as follows:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     BBPATH := "${BBPATH}:${LAYERDIR}"
                    </literallayout>
                    And, the variable <filename>BBFILES</filename> needs to be modified to include your 
                    recipe and append files:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     BBFILES := "${BBFILES} ${LAYERDIR}/images/*.bb \ 
        ${LAYERDIR}/images/*.bbappend \
        ${LAYERDIR}/recipes-*/*/*.bb \
        ${LAYERDIR}/recipes-*/*/*.bbappend"
                    </literallayout>
                    Finally, you need to be sure to use your layer name in these variables at the 
                    end of the file:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     BBFILE_COLLECTIONS += "elc"
     BBFILE_PATTERN_elc := "^${LAYERDIR}/"
     BBFILE_PRIORITY_elc = "9"
                   </literallayout>
                </para>

                <para>
                    The <filename>images</filename> directory contains an append file that helps 
                    further define the image.
                    In our example, the base image is <filename>core-image-minimal</filename>.  
                    The image does, however, need some additional modules that we are using
                    for this example.
                    These modules support the amixer functionality.
                    Here is the append file:
                    <literallayout class='monospaced'>

                   While the focus of this example is not on the BSP, it is worth mentioning that the
                   <filename>recipes-bsp</filename> directory has the recipes and append files for 
                   features that the hardware requires. 
                   In this example, there is a script and a recipe to support the 
                   <filename>amixer</filename> functionality in QEMU.
                   It is beyond the scope of this manual to go too deeply into the script.
                   Suffice it to say that the script tests for the presence of the mixer, sets up 
                   default mixer values, enables the mixer, unmutes master and then 
                   sets the volume to 100.

                   The recipe <filename>qemu86-audio.bb</filename> installs and runs the 
                   <filename>amixer</filename> when the system boots.
                   Here is the recipe:

                    The last area to look at is <filename>recipes-kernel</filename>.
                    This area holds configuration fragments and kernel append files.
                    The append file must have the same name as the kernel recipe, which is 
                    <filename>linux-yocto-2.6.37</filename> in this example.
                    The file can <filename>SRC_URI</filename> statements to point to configuration 
                    fragments you might have in the layer. 
                    The file can also contain <filename>KERNEL_FEATURES</filename> statements that specify
                    included kernel configurations that ship with the Yocto Project.
