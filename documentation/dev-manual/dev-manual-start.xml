<title>Getting Started with the Yocto Project</title>

<para>
    This chapter introduces the Yocto Project and gives you an idea of what you need to get started.  
    You can find enough information to set up your development host and build or use images for 
    hardware supported by the Yocto Project by reading  
    <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_QS_URL;'>
    The Yocto Project Quick Start</ulink>.
</para>

<para>
    The remainder of this chapter summarizes what is in the Yocto Project Quick Start and provides 
    some higher-level concepts you might want to consider.

    <title>Introducing the Yocto Project</title>

    <para>
        The Yocto Project is an open-source collaboration project focused on embedded Linux development.  
        The project currently provides a build system, which is sometimes referred to as "Poky",
        and provides various ancillary tools suitable for the embedded developer.  
        The Yocto Project also features the Sato reference User Interface, which is optimized for 
        stylus driven, low-resolution screens.
    </para>

    <para>
        You can use the Yocto Project build system, which uses 
        <ulink url='http://bitbake.berlios.de/manual/'>BitBake</ulink>, to develop complete Linux 
        images and associated user-space applications for architectures based on ARM, MIPS, PowerPC, 
        x86 and x86-64.  
        While the Yocto Project does not provide a strict testing framework,
        it does provide or generate for you artifacts that let you perform target-level and 
        emulated testing and debugging.  
        Additionally, if you are an <trademark class='trade'>Eclipse</trademark>
        IDE user, you can install an Eclipse Yocto Plug-in to allow you to 
        develop within that familiar environment.

    <title>Getting Set Up</title>

    <para>
        Here is what you need to get set up to use the Yocto Project:
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem><para><emphasis>Host System:</emphasis>  You should have a reasonably current 
                Linux-based host system.
                You will have the best results with a recent release of Fedora, 
                OpenSUSE, or Ubuntu as these releases are frequently tested against the Yocto Project
                and officially supported.  
                You should also have about 100 gigabytes of free disk space for building images.
                </para></listitem>
            <listitem><para><emphasis>Packages:</emphasis>  The Yocto Project requires certain packages
                exist on your development system (e.g. Python 2.6 or 2.7).  
                See "<ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_QS_URL;#packages'>The Packages</ulink>" 
                section in the Yocto Project Quick start for the exact package 
                requirements and the installation commands to install them 
                for the supported distributions.</para></listitem>
            <listitem id='local-yp-release'><para><emphasis>Yocto Project Release:</emphasis>  
                You need a release of the Yocto Project.  
                You can get set up with local 
                <link linkend='yocto-project-files'>Yocto Project Files</link> one of two ways 
                depending on whether you 
                are going to be contributing back into the Yocto Project source repository or not.
                <note>
                    Regardless of the method you use, this manual refers to the resulting 
                    hierarchical set of files as the "Yocto Project Files" or the "Yocto Project File
                    Structure."
                </note>
                <itemizedlist>
                    <listitem><para><emphasis>Tarball Extraction:</emphasis>  If you are not going to contribute 
                        back into the Yocto Project, you can simply download the Yocto Project release you want 
                        from the websiteâ€™s <ulink url='&YOCTO_HOME_URL;/download'>download page</ulink>.
                        Once you have the tarball, just extract it into a directory of your choice.</para>
                        <para>For example, the following command extracts the Yocto Project &DISTRO; 
                        release tarball 
                        into the current working directory and sets up the Yocto Project file structure
                        with a top-level directory named <filename>&YOCTO_POKY;</filename>:

                        </literallayout></para>
                        <para>This method does not produce a Git repository. 
                        Instead, you simply end up with a local snapshot of the 
                        Yocto Project files that are based on the particular release in the 
                        tarball.</para></listitem>

                        with the latest developments, you should use Git commands to set up a local
                        Git repository of the Yocto Project Files.
                        Doing so creates a Git repository with a complete history of changes and allows 
                        you to easily submit your changes upstream to the project.
                        Because you cloned the repository, you have access to all the Yocto Project development
                        branches and tag names used in the upstream repository.</para>
                        <para>The following transcript shows how to clone the Yocto Project Files'  
                        Git repository into the current working directory.
                        <note>The name of the Yocto Project Files Git repository in the Yocto Project Files
                        Source Repositories is <filename>poky</filename>.
                        You can view the Yocto Project Source Repositories at

                If you are going to be making modifications to a supported Linux Yocto kernel, you 
                need to establish local copies of the source.
                You can find Git repositories of supported Linux Yocto Kernels organized under
                "Yocto Linux Kernel" in the Yocto Project Source Repositories at
                <ulink url='&YOCTO_GIT_URL;/cgit.cgi'></ulink>.</para>
                <para>This setup involves creating a bare clone of the Linux Yocto kernel and then 
                copying that cloned repository.
                You can create the bare clone and the copy of the bare clone anywhere you like.
                For simplicity, it is recommended that you create these structures outside of the 
                Yocto Project Files Git repository.</para>
                <para>As an example, the following transcript shows how to create the bare clone
                of the <filename>linux-yocto-3.2</filename> kernel and then create a copy of 
                that clone.
                <note>When you have a local Linux Yocto kernel Git repository, you can 
                reference that repository rather than the upstream Git repository as 
                part of the <filename>clone</filename> command.
                Doing so can speed up the process.</note></para>
                <para>In the following example, the bare clone is named

                The Yocto Project provides a layer called <filename>meta-intel</filename> and

                <para>Similar considerations exist for setting up the <filename>meta-intel</filename>
                layer.  
                You can get set up for BSP development one of two ways: tarball extraction or
                with a local Git repository.
                It is a good idea to use the same method used to set up the Yocto Project Files.
                Regardless of the method you use, the Yocto Project uses the following BSP layer 
                naming scheme:
                <literallayout class='monospaced'> 
     meta-&lt;BSP_name&gt;

                <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     meta-crownbay

                        Again, this method just produces a snapshot of the BSP layer in the form

    <title>Using Pre-Built Binaries and QEMU</title>

    <para>
        Another option you have to get started is to use pre-built binaries. 
        The Yocto Project provides many types of binaries with each release. 
        See the <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_REF_URL;#ref-images'>Reference: Images</ulink>
        section for descriptions of the types of binaries that ship with a Yocto Project
        release.
    </para>

    <para>
        Using a pre-built binary is ideal for developing software applications to run on your 
        target hardware.  
        To do this, you need to be able to access the appropriate cross-toolchain tarball for 
        the architecture on which you are developing.  
        If you are using an SDK type image, the image ships with the complete toolchain native to 
        the architecture. 
        If you are not using an SDK type image, you need to separately download and 
        install the stand-alone Yocto Project cross-toolchain tarball.
    </para>

    <para>
        Regardless of the type of image you are using, you need to download the pre-built kernel 
        that you will boot in the QEMU emulator and then download and extract the target root 
        filesystem for your target machineâ€™s architecture.
        You can get architecture-specific binaries and filesystem from
        <ulink url='&YOCTO_MACHINES_DL_URL;'>machines</ulink>.
        You can get stand-alone toolchains from
        <ulink url='&YOCTO_TOOLCHAIN_DL_URL;'>toolchains</ulink>.
        Once you have all your files, you set up the environment to emulate the hardware 
        by sourcing an environment setup script. 
        Finally, you start the QEMU emulator.
        You can find details on all these steps in the 
        "<ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_QS_URL;#using-pre-built'>Using Pre-Built Binaries and QEMU</ulink>"
        section of the Yocto Project Quick Start. 
    </para>

    <para> 
        Using QEMU to emulate your hardware can result in speed issues
        depending on the target and host architecture mix.
        For example, using the <filename>qemux86</filename> image in the emulator 
        on an Intel-based 32-bit (x86) host machine is fast because the target and 
        host architectures match.
        On the other hand, using the <filename>qemuarm</filename> image on the same Intel-based
        host can be slower.
        But, you still achieve faithful emulation of ARM-specific issues. 
    </para>

    <para>
        To speed things up, the QEMU images support using <filename>distcc</filename>
        to call a cross-compiler outside the emulated system. 
        If you used <filename>runqemu</filename> to start QEMU, and the
        <filename>distccd</filename> application is present on the host system, any 
        BitBake cross-compiling toolchain available from the build system is automatically
        used from within QEMU simply by calling <filename>distcc</filename>.
        You can accomplish this by defining the cross-compiler variable 
        (e.g. <filename>export CC="distcc"</filename>).
        Alternatively, if you are using a suitable SDK image or the appropriate
        stand-alone toolchain is present in <filename>/opt/poky</filename>,
        the toolchain is also automatically used.
    </para>

    <note>
        Several mechanisms exist that let you connect to the system running on the 
        QEMU emulator:
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem><para>QEMU provides a framebuffer interface that makes standard 
                consoles available.</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>Generally, headless embedded devices have a serial port.
                If so, you can configure the operating system of the running image
                to use that port to run a console. 
                The connection uses standard IP networking.</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>The QEMU images have a Dropbear secure shell (ssh) server 
                that runs with the root password disabled.
                This allows you to use standard <filename>ssh</filename> and 
                <filename>scp</filename> commands.</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>The QEMU images also contain an embedded Network Files
                System (NFS) server that exports the image's root filesystem.
                This allows you to make the filesystem available to the 
                host.</para></listitem>
