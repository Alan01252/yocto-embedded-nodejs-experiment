    <title>Application Development Using the Yocto Project</title>
    <para>
        The Yocto Project supports several methods of application development through which 
        you can create user-space software designed to run on an embedded device that uses
        a Yocto Project image, which was developed with the OpenEmbedded build system. 
        This flexibility allows you to choose the method that works best for you.  
        This chapter describes each development method.

        <title>Development Within Yocto Project for a Package that Uses an External SCM</title>

        <para>
            If you're working on a recipe that pulls from an external Source Code Manager (SCM), it 
            is possible to have the OpenEmbedded build system notice new changes added to the 
            SCM and then build the package that depends on them using the latest version. 
            This only works for SCMs from which it is possible to get a sensible revision number for changes.
            Currently, you can do this with Apache Subversion (SVN), Git, and Bazaar (BZR) repositories.

            To enable this behavior, simply add the following to the <filename>local.conf</filename>
            configuration file found in the 
            <ulink url='&YOCTO_DOCS_DEV_URL;#build-directory'>build directory</ulink>:
            <literallayout class='monospaced'>
     SRCREV_pn-&lt;PN&gt; = "${AUTOREV}"
            </literallayout>
            where <filename>PN</filename> 
            is the name of the package for which you want to enable automatic source 
            revision updating.
